<h1>A Project to port POSTAL from Running with Scissors over to WebAsembaly.</h1>

This project is fully supported by Running with Scissors and carried out by the community. This will be the primary hub for the development of the new webPOSTAL version.

Currently, we need to update the source code to make it more up-to-date and easier to work with, as it currently uses Visual Studio 2013. Additionally, we are considering making edits to simplify building this version of POSTAL not only as an HTML5 app that can be iframed within any site but also as a version for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and Apple iOS (through a progressive web app or a notarized IPA in Europe).

The Contributions will be always showed on the main RWS page for Play Postal 1. Also inside of a new Credits menu next to the new Buy Postal Redux and Buy Merch menu items.

<h2>Original README</h2>

It was in September, 1997 – over 20 years ago – when us humble folk from Running With Scissors unleashed our Robotron-inspired isometric shooter POSTAL to the unsuspecting public at large. It was an instant hit, grabbing the attention of gamers, parents and politicians across the country, and we’ve been supporting and updating it ever since. 20 years later, we've entrusted our fans with the future of our game, by releasing its source code to the public.
